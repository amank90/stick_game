# Stick Game

In this project, I am creating a bot that learns the game of sticks. In the game of sticks there is a heap of sticks on a board. On their turn, each player picks up 1 to 3 sticks. The one who has to pick the final stick will be the loser. 



This problem is taken from [University of Helsinki AI problem](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2014/laaksonen-vihavainen-game-of-sticks/).  In the algorithm, two AI players play with each other and learn in the process that what should be the idle number of sticks to pick to at each step to win the game.
